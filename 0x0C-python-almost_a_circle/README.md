square.py: Class that inherits attributes references from Square class

The test files in tests:

__init__.py: Script that converts the directory as a package

test_base.py: Module that contains unittests to Base class

test_rectangle.py: Module that contains unittests to Rectangle class

test_square.py: Module that contains unittests to Square class
