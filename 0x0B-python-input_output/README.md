Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX.

Aims to learn how to open, read, write and append files from a script in Python.

Files:

0-read_file.py: Function that reads a text file and prints it to stdout

1-write_file.py: Function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written

2-append_write.py: Function that appends a string at the end of a text file

3-to_json_string.py: Function that returns the JSON representation of an object

4-from_json_string.py: Function that returns an object represented by a JSON string

5-save_to_json_file.py: Function that writes an Object to a text file, using JSON representation

6-load_from_json_file.py: Function that creates an Object from a "JSON file"

7-add_item.py: Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to add_item.json
